          <p>
            Lost World Of Tambun is an action packed, wholesome family adventure
            destination. This self-contained wonderland is cocooned by lush
            tropical jungle, natural hot springs, breathtaking limestone
            features of 400 million years of age and seven amazing attraction
            parks making it the ultimate day and night destination for a unique
            eco-adventure excursion for visitors of all ages. Just a stone’s
            throw away is the Lost World Hotel, a perfect snooze chamber after a
            long day of adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lost World Of Tambun offers not only a “lost paradise” that promises
            fun and wholesome experience for all ages but also a conducive
            learning environment with a range of fun educational elements around
            the park. We are also the only theme park in Southeast Asia with
            natural hot springs coupled with an array of attractions and rides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Business entities and MICE groups can conduct their team building
            activities or meetings at any of the Hotel’s seven function rooms
            and at the park’s themed locations (including Kepura Cave) which
            offer a capacity ranging from 10 to 200 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take pride in being able to restore the glory of a tin-mining
            wasteland to an iconic landmark that it is today putting Lost World
            Of Tambun on Malaysia’s tourist map. This is the reason we are “More
            Than Just A Theme Park!”

                Always a nice place to visit when we are back. Different pools
                available. There is a cold pool, a warm pool, and a hot pool.
                Would like more seating areas.
                <br /><br />
                The zoo/animal display is also interesting. Lots of snakes there
                to see. There are some friendly raccoons that hang around in
                that area. They are quite fun to watch.
                <br /><br />
                We usually buy online tickets for the evening entry only. That
                would be the cheapest way to do it.
                <br /><br />
                We have seen their night show before and feel that it is so-so.
                More of we have seen better percussion ensembles.

                went on a weekday, gets pretty crowded after 3pm-ish. both wet n
                dry parks have equal amount of attractions, enjoyed them all.
                water slide thingy it closes around 6pm. lots of eatery shops n
                they're worthy of money. bring your own umbrella as it can get

                I recently visited The Lost World of Tambun with my family and
                friends, and we had a wonderful time. The park is a great place
                to spend a day with loved ones, as there is something for
                everyone to enjoy. Lost World Adventure Park, has a variety of
                rides and attractions, including the Screaming Swing, the
                Treetop Challenge, and the Lost World Water Park. We had a blast
                screaming our heads off on the Screaming Swing and racing each
                other through the Treetop Challenge. loved splashing around in
                the Lost World Water Park, especially the lazy river.

                Best petting zoo I've ever been. Water slides are minimal. There
                are only 2, but it's exhilarating as ever, the pirate ship too,
                beware of human ghosts scating you about evening time, it was
                all fun. The kids water park were a blessings for adults as
                well. The wave pool area was superb. Family friendly, there's
                something for everyone all ages. We held a 70th birthday
                celebration there, the staff were super nice and accommodating
                to us - Shout out to Ms Uma and her team.

                A nice theme park suitable children of all ages. It’s value for
                money as you have access to the water theme park and also the
                rest of the rides and mini zoo. You can easily spend a full day
                there! They are very strict in food items or even personal water
                bottle and it’s not allow in the theme park. Try to keep it
                light and easy as you can easily get food and drinks within the
                theme park. Ample parking available right outside the park, so
                for those who drive need not worry. Overall we had a great time
                there.
